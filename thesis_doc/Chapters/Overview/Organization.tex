\section{Organization}

The organization of this thesis is as follows. Chapter~\ref{chap:FlowModeling} details the governing equations, thermodynamic and transport models, chemical reaction models, and spatio-temporal discretization methods used to obtain results exhibited in later chapters. Chapter~\ref{chap:ProjROMs} discusses relevant literature on projection-based reduced-order modeling techniques and derives those methods which are investigated in later chapters, with in-depth discussions on the MP-LSVT method and scalable hyper-reduction and adaptation of PROMS for combusting flow problems. Chapter~\ref{chap:CavityAndCVRC} exhibits numerical experiments of hyper-reduced PROMs for two intermediate-complexity multi-scale problems: 2D transonic flow over an open cavity, and a 3D truncated single-element rocket combustor. Chapter~\ref{chap:NineElement} provides results for numerical experiments of a 3D nine-element rocket combustor, the largest test case for PROMs to date (to the best of the author's knowledge). Chapter~\ref{chap:TransientFlame} outlines PERFORM, the open-source ROM development testbed, and novel results comparing linear and non-linear ROMs for an acoustically-forced, freely-propagating model premixed flame. Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:Conclusion} summarizes the results and meaningful conclusions of this research, and proposes several important future research directions.
