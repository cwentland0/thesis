\section{Data-driven Reduced-order Modeling}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Necessity of finding low-cost models for design, uncertainty quantification, failure analysis (``many-query'' buzzword)
    \item Explicit characterization of different cost-reduction methods. All are inherently ``reduced-order'', but we use that here to describe process where order reduction is the specific goal.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Physics-inspired models
        \item Empirical surrogates
        \item Projection-based models
    \end{itemize}
    \item Early attempts at learning reaction model and combustion instability model surrogates from experiments
    \item Linear projection-based ROMs
    \item Non-linear projection-based ROMs
    \item Black/gray box
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Operator inference
        \item Machine-learning surrogates
    \end{itemize}
