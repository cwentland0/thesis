\section{Simulation of Reacting Fluid Flows}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Brief description of simulating fluid flows
    \item Explain difficulties in modeling reacting flows, small characteristic spatio-temporal scales
    \item Computational cost of well-resolved rocket combustion simulations
    \item Range of available reaction models (finite rate w/ or w/o reduced mechanism, flame transfer functions, FPV), varying accuracy and cost
\end{itemize}
