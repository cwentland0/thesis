The founding motivation for this work stems from a need to better predict combustion instabilities in rocket combustion, and from there expanded to explore more fundamental issues in applying data-driven order-reduction techniques to multi-scale and reacting fluid flows. Although work in this thesis approximates the multi-phase nature of liquid-propellant rocket combustion with pure gas-phase combustion, it is critical to understand the context of modern rocket engine design and the future trajectory of modeling efforts in this field. This discussion begins with a brief primer on rocket engines and the destructive combustion instabilities often encountered in their design. General issues of extreme computational cost in simulating reacting flows are then addressed, along with contemporary attempts to alleviate this cost with data-driven models.
