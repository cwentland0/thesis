Broadly, this thesis aims to develop rigorous projection-based reduced-order models for complex multi-scale, multi-physics systems. The founding motivation for this work stems from a need to better predict the mechanisms of combustion instabilities in liquid-propellant rocket combustion, and from there expanded to explore more fundamental issues in applying data-driven order-reduction techniques to multi-scale and reacting fluid flows. We begin by providing a brief primer on liquid propellant rocket engines and the destructive combustion instabilities often encountered in their design. We then address the general issues of extreme computational cost in simulating reacting flows, and contemporary attempts to alleviate this cost with data-driven models.
