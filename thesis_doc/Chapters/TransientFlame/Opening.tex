We turn now to a much simpler reacting flow system, a model of one-dimensional premixed combustion, in order to explore the uses and drawbacks of novel neural network ROM approaches, specifically order reduction by deep convolutional autoencoders and system evolution by either non-linear manifold PROMs or recurrent neural networks. We will discuss the open-source software developed for this work, the mechanics of the neural network ROMs, and the respective successes and failures of both linear subspace and non-linear manifold ROMs.
