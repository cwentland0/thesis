To begin, a simple model of one-dimensional premixed combustion is investigated in order to explore the uses and drawbacks of novel neural network ROM approaches, specifically order reduction by deep convolutional autoencoders and system evolution by either non-linear manifold PROMs or recurrent neural networks. The open-source software developed for this work is discussed, along with the mechanics of the neural network ROMs and the respective successes and failures of both linear subspace and non-linear manifold ROMs.
