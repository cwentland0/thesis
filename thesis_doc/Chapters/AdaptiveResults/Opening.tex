For the results shown in Chapter~\ref{chap:HPROMResults}, all simulations have simply \textit{reconstructed} the training data. That is, the geometry, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and simulation duration of each PROM is identical to those of the FOM from which the training data is extracted. Although these simulations were successful in this effort, the ultimate goal of any data-driven method is \textit{generalizability}. To be truly useful for engineering applications, such methods must be able to make fast and accurate predictions for unseen configurations which are not accounted for in the training data. 

\section{Failure of Static Trial Bases}

The PROMs investigated in Chapter~\ref{chap:HPROMResults} are, unfortunately, not generalizable. To demonstrate this for the truncated CVRC case examined in Section~\ref{sec:cvrc}, the unsampled MP-LSVT PROM is allowed to run for a longer duration than the original FOM training data, to $\timeVar = 5.6$ ms. The resulting dump plane corner pressure probe is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cvrcStaticFutureState}. Even though the PROM is capable of simulating the training period with exceptionally high accuracy, the solution rapidly deviates shortly after the end of the training period at $\timeVar = 5.5$ ms. The dominant cause of this failure is the inability of the linear trial space to model realizations of the flow field which were not included in the training data. In a sense, this is an attempt at \textit{extrapolation} in time (rather than a sort of \textit{interpolation} within the training set). Although disappointing, this result is not at all surprising, as data-driven methods often struggle to model unseen data, particularly for highly non-linear systems.

\end{figure}

The inability of the trial basis to represent unseen data is made readily apparent by observing the average projection error over time in Fig.~\ref{fig:cvrcStaticProjTime}. After $\timeVar = 5.5$ ms, the projection error drastically increases, and increasing the dimension of the trial basis is unable to improve this whatsoever. This can be visually observed in pressure probe measurements of the projected solution in Fig.~\ref{fig:cvrcStaticProjProbe}, where large discrepancies can be observed beyond $\timeVar = 5.5$ ms.

\end{figure}

Further, comparisons of the FOM and projected pressure and temperature fields at $\timeVar = 5.6$ ms can be seen in Figs.~\ref{fig:cvrcStaticPressureProjSlice} and~\ref{fig:cvrcStaticTempProjSlice}. In both instances, the solution appears smeared and more axisymmetric, lacking most of the transient features of the flow field such as the  highly distorted flame front in the combustion chamber. As the online PROM cannot be expected to model the unsteady solution more accurately than the projected solution, the previous failure of the PROM is to be expected.

Given the poor performance of the unsampled PROM, it can be safely assumed that any HPROM will perform as poorly or worse. Ultimately, the failure lies purely with the fact that an accurate solution does not exist in the trial space. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:adaptation}, adaptation of the trial basis during the online PROM runtime proposes a solution to this lack of trial space expressiveness. In theory, the trial space can be altered to more accurately represent the solution at a given point in the unsteady simulation. Some authors~\cite{Abgrall2016,Grimberg2021} achieve this with dictionaries of trial bases, swapping one trial basis for a more accurate trial basis dependent on minimizing some online error metric. However, such approaches are still computed from a fixed dataset and cannot be expected to represent significant deviations in the online solution. Additionally, the size of datasets which can produce such dictionaries of accurate trial bases may be prohibitively large.

The results below explore true online adaptation of the trial space by the one-step basis adaptation method proposed by Huang \textit{et al.}~\cite{Huang2022a}. To achieve computational speedup, adaptation of the HPROM sample mesh via a modification of the AADEIM approach by Peherstorfer~\cite{Peherstorfer2020Adaptive} is also explored.
