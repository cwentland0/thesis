This thesis has examined projection-based reduced-order models for several multi-scale systems, with a strong emphasis on reacting flows and rocket combustors. To conclude, the main insights drawn from these experiments are highlighted, including particularly successful methods and practices, as well as challenges which frustrated attempts at producing stable, accurate, and efficient simulations. Lastly, I will outline a few additional questions this work prompted which might serve as interesting topics for future research.
