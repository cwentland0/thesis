This thesis investigated projection-based reduced-order models for  multi-scale transport-dominated systems, with a particular emphasis on reacting flows and rocket combustor applications. Attention was given to the application of these ROMs for problems of much larger dimensions and complexity than has been attempted in the literature. The main insights drawn from these experiments are highlighted below, including particularly successful methods and practices, as well as challenges which frustrated attempts at producing stable, accurate, and efficient simulations. A few additional questions which might serve as interesting topics for future research are also presented.
