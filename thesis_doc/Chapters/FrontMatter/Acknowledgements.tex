USING THIS SPACE FOR NOTES
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bib items for arXiv are messed up
	\item Bib items should probably show all authors
	\item Need to double check DOIs, Mendeley seems to have messed some of them up
	\item Summations over x, y, z in Gov Eqs is a little weird. Any way to fix?
	\item Need discussion on whether to put PERFORM first or after GEMS results. Start with simple 1D, or keep niche non-linear ROMs in the back?
	\item Should solution be parameterized? Only really matters for 1D flame, but might not hurt to be general
	\item Need to make decoder notation cleaner w/r/t the scaling matrix
	\item Be consistent about time step indices (use $\timeIdx + 1$ and $\timeIdx$, or $\timeIdx$ and $\timeIdx - 1$). Same with Newton iteration.
	\item Make sure notation of residual and RHS functions are consistent ($\rhsFunc{\cdot}$ vs. $\rhsFunc{\cdot, \timeVar}$, etc)
	\item Specific symbols for residual Jacobians w/r/t primitive vs conservative coefficients
	\item Mention scalar vs vector POD?
	\item Consistency in RHS/residual arguments, use full order but expand POD expression
	\item Time step index on time values, e.g. $\timeVar^{\timeIdx}$
\end{itemize}
