% Just summarize everything once it's done. Should be something like the following:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Simulations can be invaluable for engineering, but out of reach for many reacting systems
%     \item Data-driven methods are improving, but still unaddressed issues of offline and online cost, generalizability
%     \item ROMs for non-linear systems require hyper-reduction, thesis explores tradeoffs in sample selection.
%     \item Linear ROMs are well studied, but have predictive accuracy issues. Adaptivity addresses this.
%     \item  Non-linear ROMs can improve solution accuracy, but hard to justify offline cost, cost of evaluating Jacobians
%     \item Exploring sensitivity of ROMs to conditioning, improvement via MP-LSVT. 
% \end{itemize}
