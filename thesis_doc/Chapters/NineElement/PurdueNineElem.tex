\section{Purdue Nine-element Combustor}

{\color{red}FFCM-1 comes from~\cite{ffcm1}, but FFCMy-12 (reduction of FFCM-1) was from personal communication to AFRL. It doesn't seem to be published yet. Should I ask for explicit permission (Rui Xu and Hai Wang, Stanford)? Most folks seem to cite their HyChem papers, but I don't see how those are related.}
