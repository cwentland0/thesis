In this chapter, we outline the governing equations which describe reacting fluid flows, and the numerical methods by which these equations are discretized in space and time for results presented in this thesis. With the exception of those generated by PERFORM and presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:TransientFlame}, all results are computed using the General Equations and Mesh Solver (GEMS). This solver was originally developed by Guoping Xia at Purdue University, and over nearly two decades has been used extensively to model a wide variety of complex combusting flow systems. More recently, it has been expanded to include projection-based reduced-order modeling utilities, which will be described in greater detail in Chapter~\ref{chap:ProjROMs}. Although PERFORM uses an extremely similar formulation to GEMS, discrepancies will be explicitly described in Chapter~\ref{chap:TransientFlame}.
